                        inheritance to reach
                        the number of the registered contract and the court that issued it). In addition, the buyer must
                        receive all
                        previous ownership contracts from the seller (in case of purchasing an apartment or a shop from
                        the owner of
                        a building or tower and due to the difficulty of delivering those documents, as the owner sells
                        to others,
                        copies of all sales contracts for the land of the property must be obtained from the owner, and
                        the owner

            <h3>Required Documents, Conditions, and Terms for Buying a Property:</h3>
        </summary>
        <article>
            <div class="policy-slot">
                <strong>First: Required Documents</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The registered ownership document (known as "the Green Contract") is the best proof of ownership
                        and contains a month and date stamp. It can be obtained from the Real Estate Registration
                        Authority by anyone, even if they are not a party to the contract, for a fee.</li>
                    <li>The unregistered sales contract is the initial contract signed between the parties and sealed
                        with the eagle seal, indicated by the phrase "considered in lawsuit number X". This means that a
                        judgment has been issued on the validity of the seller's signature on this contract, and there
                        must be a sealed judgment containing this text, stating that the court has ruled on the validity
                        of the defendant's signature on the sales contract dated X. This seal does not mean that the
                        unit is registered, and it is not a declaration of the unit's registration, but it is widely
                        used by everyone due to its low cost.</li>
                    <li>Note: There is a common misunderstanding among people regarding the difference between the
                        initial and final contracts. Both can be referred to as "initial contracts." The only true final
                        contract is the registered Green Contract.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the contract, it is necessary to review the latest electricity, water, gas, and
                        telephone bills (if available). A copy of everything mentioned and any other documents, such as
                        building permits or ownership sequence documents, should be obtained.</li>
                    <li>The fifth step is to inquire with the district responsible for the property and the unit's owner
                        about the unit's status and services, such as whether it has a building permit or if it is in
                        violation. If the services have not yet been connected, such as electricity, there may be a
                        problem connecting them to the apartment.</li>
                    <li>Sixth, after inquiring about the property in the district, inquire about all the services
                        available in the unit, such as electricity, water, gas, and central services, by reviewing
                        previous receipts. Ensure that the unit's owner has contracted for these services and has paid
                        for them until the last date to purchase the unit.</li>
                    <li>In conclusion, buying a property requires obtaining the necessary documents, verifying their
                        validity, checking the property's status and services, and ensuring that the seller is legally
                        authorized to sell the property. Additionally, the payment method must be agreed upon and
                        documented in the sales contract, and all taxes and fees related to the favourite must be
                        paid.</li>
                    <li>Seventh, the registered ownership document (known as "the Green Contract") is checked. In this
                        case, there is an assumption that the contract is valid. The Green Contract should be taken to
                        the Real Estate Registration Authority, where it will be stamped for a fee and returned with the
                        date and month of registration. A copy of the contract should be obtained and presented to the
                        authority to confirm its validity. The piece of land, boundaries, and area of the unit must be
                        specified in the contract.</li>
                    <li>The unregistered sales contract, which is the initial contract signed between the parties and
                        sealed with the eagle seal and indicated by the phrase "considered in lawsuit number X". This
                        means that a judgment has been issued on the validity of the seller's signature on this
                        contract, and there must be a sealed judgment containing this text, stating that the court has
                        ruled on the validity of the defendant's signature on the sales contract dated X. This does not
                        mean that the unit is registered, and this seal is not a declaration of the unit's registration,
                        but it is widely used by everyone due to its low cost.</li>
                    <em>Note: There is a common misunderstanding among people regarding the difference between the
                        initial and final contracts. Both can be referred to as "initial contracts." The only true final
                        contract is the registered Green Contract.</em>
                    <li>Eighth, after completing all the necessary inquiries and verifying the validity of the ownership
                        document and building permits for the property and the unit, the sales contract is written. It
                        should include the ownership sequence, the seller's guarantee of possessing the unit, and his
                        guarantee of any latent defects. The boundaries of the property and unit should also be
                        mentioned. A clause should be included in which the seller agrees to issue a power of attorney
                        to the buyer for selling to himself or others and dealing with all government and non-government
                        entities.</li>
                    <li>Ninth and finally, after signing the contracts, both parties should go to the Real Estate
                        Registration Authority to issue a power of attorney from the seller to the buyer, as previously
                        explained. This power of attorney allows the buyer to handle any government favourites
                        (electricity, water, gas, telephone, etc.) in his name, relieving the seller of any further
                        obligations.</li>
                </ol>
                <em>In conclusion, buying a property requires several procedures, including obtaining the necessary
                    documents, checking their validity, verifying the unit's status and services, and ensuring that the
                    seller is legally authorized to sell the property. Additionally, the payment method must be agreed
                    upon and documented in the sales contract, and all taxes and fees related to the favourite must be
                    paid.</em>

            <div class="policy-slot">
                <strong>Second: Terms and Conditions</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>The unregistered sales contract is considered a valid contract, and it does not prevent the sale
                        from being valid.</li>
                    <li>Both registered and unregistered contracts are considered valid.</li>
                    <li>The buyer has the right to demand delivery of the property and request it to be placed under
                        custody if there are concerns about the property's safety.</li>
                    <li>The buyer has legal ownership of the property and can file lawsuits related to it, including
                        eviction of the seller from the property and requesting its delivery to the buyer.</li>
                    <li>The buyer has the right to object to the sale of the property to a tenant by the seller before
                        registering the contract, and the seller cannot lease the property to the buyer despite being
                        the owner until the registration is complete. However, if the seller has not yet delivered the
                        property to the tenant, the buyer can request its delivery.</li>
                    <li>The buyer has ownership rights to any crops or fruits produced by the property.</li>
                    <li>In the case of an unregistered contract, the buyer has the right to demand the seller to deliver
                        any crops produced by the property.</li>
                    <li>The buyer has ownership rights to the registered property, while the unregistered contract
                        transfers all rights and lawsuits related to the sale to the buyer. The buyer can receive the
                        property and evict any intruders, but ownership rights are not transferred.</li>
                    <li>Before registration, the buyer is only a regular debtor to the seller and has no direct
                        relationship with the tenant. The buyer's relationship with the seller ends when the
                        registration is complete.</li>
                    <li>If the seller (old owner) transfers the lease contract to the buyer (new owner) before the
                        registration, the buyer can demand the tenant's rights, including rent, without the need for the
                        old owner's involvement.</li>
                    <li>The buyer has the right to benefit from the property and all rights related to it, and can
                        replace the seller in these rights before other partners in the property. This includes the
                        right to enjoy what the seller had before the sale, and to benefit from it in proportion to the
                        buyer's share in the property.</li>
                    <li>The deposit is the amount that one of the contractors provides to the other when creating the
                        contract, and the contractors may agree to make their contract binding and final or allow each
                        of them the right to sign or cancel the contract. This is determined solely by the intention of
                        the contractors or the value of the compensation agreed upon in case of contract termination due
                        to one of the contractors' failure to fulfill their obligations or the value of the deposit. The
                        deposit may be the amount paid by the buyer to the seller under the sales contract, which the
                        buyer will lose if the sale is not completed, or it may be part of the price that is not subject
                        to the seller's jurisdiction as compensation if the buyer cancels the contract due to their
                        mistake and causes harm to the seller. The buyer's cancellation may be due to a hidden defect in
                        the property sold.</li>
                    <li>If the sales contract includes a condition in which the seller prohibits the buyer from
                        disposing of the property until the seller's death, and the seller retains the right to benefit
                        from it throughout their life as a guarantee of their right, this does not prevent the
                        favourite from being considered a valid sale contract for ownership. This condition does not
                        mean that the sale is only a will.</li>
                    <li>The seller may issue a sales contract in the form of a gift contract for his children, and it is
                        considered a valid contract as long as the favourite is not subject to any additional
                        conditions after the seller's death. If the contract is executed during the seller's lifetime,
                        who has waived his rights to the property under this contract, and the contract is in the
                        possession of the administrator who has taken the necessary registration procedures or submitted
                        it to the court to obtain the validity of the seller's signature, then the contract is valid and
                        effective.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The buyer must verify the seller's identity, description, and whether they are an authorized
                        representative or agent of a company by reviewing official documents and keeping a copy.</li>
                    <li>The buyer must confirm the validity and duration of the authorization by sending a recent
                        official copy of it.</li>
                    <li>The buyer must review and confirm the validity of the seller's property title by obtaining a
                        recent official copy.</li>
                    <li>The buyer must obtain a negative certificate regarding any property favourites related to the
                        land.</li>
                    <li>The buyer should seek assistance from the survey and real estate registration departments to
                        obtain an approved land division.</li>
                    <li>The buyer should consult the engineering departments in the neighborhoods or city councils to
                        confirm whether the land is suitable for construction or not.</li>
                    <li>The buyer should avoid purchasing land owned by government entities such as housing ministry or
                        city agencies.</li>
                    <li>If the seller's property title is registered with the real estate registry or the land register,
                        the buyer must check the ownership sequence of the seller until the last registered contract. If
                        the ownership is not registered, the buyer should investigate the possibility of registering it.
                        There is a risk of invalidating any contract in the ownership sequence, including the seller's
                        contract, if it is not registered.</li>
